        Hired as on a 6 month contract, I worked as a
        <strong>Software Developer</strong> at Pax for a total of 9 months.
        After fulfilling my contract, Pax offered me a full-time position. This
        was my first opportunity to work exclusively in a development role, and
        I learned a great deal from my time here! I was exposed to primarily
        Java and JavaScript projects, for both mobile and web-based
        applications. These projects all fell within the umbrella of
        <strong>Payment Card Industry</strong>, and included a Point of Sale
        application.

      <h2 class="experience-title">Hazlnut, LLC</h2>
      <p class="experience-body">
        Hazlnut offered me my first position after graduating college, and I
        accepted the <strong>Software Support</strong> role. While employed
        here, my responsibilites were primarily to work directly with clients
        for both onboarding and resolving any issues with the Hazlnut service.
        Hazlnut offered an integration with the Clover POS system to support
        online and mobile ordering, as well as a loyalty and rewareds system.
        Working with non-technical restaurant owners greatly improved my
        <strong>patience and professional communication skills.</strong>

        Not only did I work in this support role, but Hazlnut also allowed me to
        practice my programming skills, particularly utilizing
        <strong>Python</strong> to automate recurring support tasks. The most
        involved automation allowed the support team to fully onboard a new
        client by supplying a payload with the client's information. This
        payload would be validated and included in both the company and HubSpot
        databases. Automating this task turned an hour of data entry into only a
        few minutes!
